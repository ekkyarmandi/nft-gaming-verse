## Todo:
---
* Rename all the layers to match the attribut naming rule `<layer_position>_<trait_type>_<trait_name>`.
* Write a `compiler` function to create a attribute.json and source.svg file.
* Write a `generate` function to generate the random combination for the project by applying the exclusion rule and use the attribute.json as the source input.
* Write a `export` function to export the artworks based on the metadata information and source.svg file as the source input.
